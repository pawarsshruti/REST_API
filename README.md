# REST_API
This is a project where I have build my own REST API. 
This REST API stores the data of workers which includes: name, email, gender, department, city.
While making this project I had the opportunity to learn about how APIs and REST APIs work, what is http protocol,
what are some http methods like GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE etc.
